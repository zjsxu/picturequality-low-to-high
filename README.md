this set of files functions separately, based on the scenario given.
file.py is the main function, which runs with the premise that a legalized .json bank has been generated. It intakes the absolute address of the json file, the folder with the low quality images, and the target folder where the results are to be placed. Its output includes two parts 1)if the high quality version of the given image is found, then the former will be introduced to the the target folder; 2) if the high quality version doesn't exist, the original image would be copied into a child folder of the target folder,named "未找到原图".
build_image_index.py is designed for initialization. It takes in the address of the general folder with all potential high quality images, and in the case where there's no existing .pkl file, it would traverse through all those (contain or are) image files (jpg,jpeg,pdf,word) to generate a .json .pkl directory for faster traversal
fileintegrate.py is for traversing the images and those word/pdf files containing the images and extract them out RAWLY, which means that it can be the fronter function to the file.py 
structure.py is a small tactic to generate the branch tree version of a huge folder directory, which may lead to easier understanding to any generative AI thus make your own adaptations
